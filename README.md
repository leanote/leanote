## 2. Why we created leanote
To be honest, our inspiration comes from Evernote. We use Evernote to manage our knowledge everyday. But we find that:
* Evernote's editor can't meet our needs, it does not have document navigation, it does not render code properly (as a programmer, syntax highlighted code rendering is a basic need), it cannot resize images and so forth
* We like markdown, but Evernote does not support it.
* We want to share our knowledge, so all of us have our blogs (e.g. on Wordpress) and our Evernote accounts, but why can not those two be one!
